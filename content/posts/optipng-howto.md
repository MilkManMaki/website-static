![PNG Compression](/images/featured-png.png)

### What is optipng?

`optipng` is a command-line tool that optimizes PNG images. It works by recompressing image files to reduce their size while maintaining the original image qualityâ€”this is known as "lossless" compression. Smaller image files are a significant advantage for websites.

### Why Optimize Images for Websites?

* **Faster Page Loads:** Smaller PNG files mean your website content loads faster for visitors. This is crucial for a positive user experience.
* **Improved SEO:** Search engines like Google favor fast-loading websites, so image optimization can indirectly boost your search engine rankings.
* **Reduced Bandwidth Costs:** If you have a high-traffic website, smaller image sizes translate to less bandwidth used, potentially saving you money on hosting costs.

### Installing optipng on Linux

The installation process varies slightly depending on your Linux distribution:

#### Debian/Ubuntu based

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install optipng
```

#### Fedora/RHEL based

```bash
sudo dnf install optipng 
```

#### Arch based

```bash
sudo pacman -S optipng
```

### Batch Processing Images with optipng

#### Basic Usage

**Optimize all PNGs in the current directory:**

```bash
optipng *.png
```

#### Advanced Examples

**Optimize PNGs in the current directory and all subdirectories recursively:**

```bash
optipng -dir . *.png 
```

**Optimize PNGs while preserving the original file's timestamp (useful for version control):**

```bash
optipng -preserve *.png
```

**More aggressive optimization level (slightly slower, but can yield better compression):**

```bash
optipng -o7 *.png
```

**Optimize only PNGs that are larger than 500KB:**

```bash
find . -size +500k -iname "*.png" -exec optipng -o7 {} \; 
```

#### Explanation of Common Options

* `-dir`:  Specifies a directory for output files. Useful for recursive optimization when you want to maintain directory structure and avoid overwriting originals.
* `-preserve`: Preserves the original file's modification timestamp.
* `-o7`: Highest optimization level. Offers maximum compression, but the process may be slightly slower.

#### Important Considerations

* `optipng` works in-place, meaning it directly modifies the original files. It's always advisable to create backups of your images before running large batch optimizations.

### Using a Bash Script + `find`

Here's a simple bash script to optimize all PNG files in a directory:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

for file in *.png; do
    optipng -o7 "$file"  # -o7 for maximum optimization
done
```

#### How to Use the Script

1. **Save:** Save the code above as a file (e.g., `optimize_images.sh`)
2. **Place in Directory:** Put the script file in the directory containing your PNG images.
3. **Make Executable:**  Run `chmod +x optimize_images.sh` in your terminal to make the script executable.
4. **Run:** Execute the script by typing `./optimize_images.sh`

##### Important Notes

* Optipng creates optimized versions of images. It's a good practice to back up your original images before running it.
* The script overwrites the original PNGs. If you want to keep the originals, modify the script to save optimized versions with a different filename.
