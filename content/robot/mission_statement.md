The Mission of the Snider High School Robotics Team is to develop 
students' interest in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) 
through robotics competitions and other projects. 
Robotics competitions foster student's interest in STEM, develop 
leadership and skills in team effectiveness, and develop a community of 
excited learners. 
The Snider High School Robotics Team provides a place where all 
students, especially those interested in careers involving technology, can 
thrive. 
We hope to inspire students who never thought they could do this kind of 
work, and to encourage students to explore career alternatives.
